## Its a really odd name you have there, where did it come from?
The name is from Vera the Callahan Full-bore Auto-lock in Firefly.

>"Six men came to kill me one time. And the best of 'em carried this. It's a Callahan full-bore auto-lock. Customized trigger, double cartridge thorough gauge. It is my very favorite gun ... This is the best gun made by man. It has *extreme* sentimental value ... I Call Her Vera."
